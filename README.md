# Golang Retweet Bot

It is Golang retweet bot. It's search for the hashtag #Golangjob and retweets it on its account. I build it during my #100daysofCode challenge on day one.

1. Searches for the tweets with hashtag #Golangjob and retweet them.
2. Follow back the Follower.
3. Compitable to [Go Meta Linter](https://github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter)
4. Greet the follower.

## ToDo
1. Write code do only unique retweets
2. Write code to Greet and follow only new follower
3. Create a Cron job to auto-execute it.
4. Setup it using Docker.
5. Test the Code and put it on a production server.
