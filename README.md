# Golang Retweet Bot

It is Golang retweet bot. It's search for the hashtag #Golangjob and retweets it on its account. I build it during my #100daysofCode challenge on day one.

## Current Features
1. Searches for the tweets with hashtag #Golangjob and retweet them.
2. Follow back the Follower.
3. Greet the follower.
4. Greet and follow only new follower.
5. Do only unique Retweets

## ToDo
1. Create a Cron job to auto-execute it.
2. Setup it using Docker.
3. Test the Code and put it on a production server.
